This is the userland kernel library which you can link your
applications against to create your userland applications
and libraries.


QUICK HOW TO
------------

make compile


RESULTS
-------

Now, you're only interested in the resulting libkernel.a and
the ./include subdirectory.  Copy the libkernel.a to your 
library path - wherever you want it to be - and copy the 
contents of ./include/ to your include path - wherever you 
want it to be.

Link against it whenever you compile your userland application
for the spoon microkernel. Pretty easy.

PS: Be sure to use a correct linker script for the userland
applications.
