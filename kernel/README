Hey! Sorry for the mistake but this is a new re-write of the kernel and is incomplete at the moment. You should have downloaded the snapshot.tar.gz and look for the "old_kernel" directory.



To read and follow the instructions in the kernel....

start: jump.S/__entry
follow: init.c

glance: kernel.ld
glance: Makefile
